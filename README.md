### Break down into end to end tests

We have broken our testing into model testing and feature testing.
Our feature tests look a bit like this:
```
scenario "owner can confirm the request" do
  owner_receives_a_request
  click_button "Confirm"
  expect(page.current_path).to eq "/requests"
  expect(page).to have_content "Status: Confirmed"
end
```

And our model tests look like this:

```
it "authenticates when given a valid email address and password" do
  authenticated_user = User.authenticate("example@email.com", "1234")
  expect(authenticated_user).to eq user
end
```
